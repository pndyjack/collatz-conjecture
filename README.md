# Collatz Conjecture

The Collatz Conjecture or 3x+1 problem can be summarized as follows:

Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide n by 2 to get n / 2. If n is
odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1. Repeat the process indefinitely.
The conjecture states that no matter which number you start with, you will
always reach 1 eventually.

Given a number n, return the number of steps required to reach 1.

## Examples

Starting with n = 12, the steps would be as follows:

0. 12
1. 6
1. 3
1. 10
1. 5
1. 16
1. 8
1. 4
1. 2
1. 1

Resulting in 9 steps. So for input n = 12, the return value would be 9.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored. After you get the first test to
pass, open the tests source file which is located in the `tests` directory
and remove the `#[ignore]` flag from the next test and get the tests to pass
again. Each separate test is a function with `#[test]` flag above it.
Continue, until you pass every test.

If you wish to run all tests without editing the tests source file, use:

```bash
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

To run a specific test, for example `some_test`, you can use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test
```

If the specific test is ignored use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test -- --ignored
```
